# play-chess
play chess with a simple python script


Run this script: chess.py
Written for Python 2.7

Ignore other scripts.


Run chess.py in Terminal/Command Line to use a functional chess board.

Use standard chess commands to move pieces:
e.g. 
"e2 to e4" will move the piece (at the beginning of the game, the pawn) 
that is currently on the e2 square to the e4 square.

Have fun!
