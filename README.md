# play-chess
create a simple functioning chess board with a single python script

chess.py
Written for Python 2.7


Run chess.py in Terminal/Command Line.

Use standard chess commands to move pieces:
e.g. 
"e2 to e4" will move the piece (which is, at the beginning of the game, the pawn) 
that is currently on the e2 square to the e4 square.

It is like a real chess board in that you can move any piece to any square. It's up to you to follow
the rules of chess gameplay.

Have fun!
